This creates a native wrapper around managed C# classes using C++/Cli.

Include a reference to CSharpToCpp.DLL and mark the classes you want exposed using the ExposeToCpp Attribute.

For Example:

    [ExposeToCpp]
    public class TestClass : BaseClass
    {
        public String ClassName { get; set; }
        public int ClassCount { get; set; }

        public TestClass()
        {
        }
	}
	
	
Then run CSharpToCppGenerator pointed at your Dll and it will parse it generating the files you need to complie 
into a c++/cli dll.

Works with String and native types (int, double, bool). Support for List and Dictonary soon.
